# Math-156-Machine-Learning
Math 156 Machine Learning course taught by Professor Lyu at UCLA. Covered algorithms for classification such as polynomial, logistic and prohibit regression. Formulated neural network models, specifically feed-forward and convolutional neural networks. Applied and proved matrix factorization and dictionary learning to machine learning facial recognition models. Additional topics covered include Naive Bayes, Probalbistic PCA, Gaussian Methods. Class was both proof based and applied using python intensively. 

The "homework" write-up folder contains my work/anaysis for both the theory and computational assignments done in this class.

The "notebook" folder contains python notebooks authored by Professor Hanbaek Lyu and modified by myself, these were used to complete homeworks.

The "final project" folder contains my work using naive bayes, regression, and neural networks to detect heart-disease in patients. The data-set, code, and write-up are all attatched.
